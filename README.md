# Harry Potter character search form
**How it works** : the application is connected to a Harry Potter character database. You can enter a Harry Potter character name in the search form and the application shows you the matching character cards. You can also sort the characters by gender and/or Hogwarts house

**How it was made**: the application uses VueJS version 3 and is connected to a Heroku API.
